- 👋 Hello, my name is @Marthyna and I am an undergraduate student at CompSci at UFRGS, currently attending the 3rd semester.
- 👀 I am interested in developing simple and efficient software to solve everyday problems (given my current level in programming), working mainly with Python and Java.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm learning more about browser automation using Python and the Selenium library, while developing software that will automate the process of downloading music 
      from YouTube, given a certain Spotify playlist.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that investigate how to code more efficiently, possibly with an emphasis on data mining, as this is an area I would like to explore.
- 📫 You can reach me through https://www.linkedin.com/in/marthyna/ or mlwber@inf.ufrgs.br
